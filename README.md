# CheatSheet
Hi this is a cheatsheet for anyone comming from c# background to godot.
To use this class functions inside your project simply add:
using static CheatSheet.BasicFunctions;

Feel free to both use this class and add new functions to it.
Remember all functions have to be static.

Ultimately though the purpose of this class isnt to support your project long term but simply as an introduction to godot.
So that you can quickly see how to do various basic things in godot.
